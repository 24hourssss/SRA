# Pytorch implementation Self-Rule to Adapt (SRA):
## Self-Rule to Adapt: Generalized Multi-source Feature Learning Using Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Colorectal Cancer Tissue Detection

Supervised learning is constrained by the availability of labeled data, which are especially expensive to acquire in 
the field of digital pathology. Making use of open-source data for pre-training or using domain adaptation can be a 
way to overcome this issue. However, pre-trained networks often fail to generalize to new test domains that are not 
distributed identically due to variations in tissue stainings, types, and textures. Additionally, current domain 
adaptation methods mainly rely on fully-labeled source datasets.

In this work, we propose SRA, which takes advantage of self-supervised learning to perform domain adaptation and 
removes the necessity of a fully-labeled source dataset. SRA can effectively transfer the discriminative knowledge 
obtained from a few labeled source domain's data to a new target domain without requiring additional tissue annotations. 
Our method harnesses both domains' structures by capturing visual similarity with intra-domain and cross-domain 
self-supervision. Moreover, we present a generalized formulation of our approach that allows the architecture to learn 
from multi-source domains. We show that our proposed method outperforms baselines for domain adaptation of colorectal 
tissue type classification and further validate our approach on our in-house clinical cohort. The code and models are 
available open-source:

### Pretrained models

You can download part of the model used for the publication. The `pretrained` version is composed of the two branches 
of the architecture without the linear classifier. The `classification` model is only composed of one branch as well as 
the classification (source) layer. We indicate the source and target dataset used for each training.

## Training

### Step 1: Download publicly available data (source)
Here is a non-exhaustive list of the publicly available dataset of colorectal tissues:


<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Name</th>
    <th>#Samples</th>
    <th>#Classes</th>
    <th colspan="2">Links</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Kather16</td>
    <td>5,000</td>
    <td>8</td>
    <td><a href="https://zenodo.org/record/53169">download</a></td>
    <td><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/srep27988">paper</a></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Kather19</td>
    <td>100,000</td>
    <td>9</td>
    <td><a href="https://zenodo.org/record/1214456">download</a></td>
    <td><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1002730">paper</a></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>CRCTP</td>
    <td>196,000</td>
    <td>7</td>
    <td><a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/cross_fac/tia/data/crc-tp">download</a></td>
    <td><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S136184152030061X">paper</a></td>
  </tr>
</table>
  
You can download the previous dataset using the commands:
```bash
# Create data folder
mkdir data

# Download Kather16 training/test data
wget -O Kather_texture_2016_image_tiles_5000.zip https://zenodo.org/record/53169/files/Kather_texture_2016_image_tiles_5000.zip?download=1
unzip Kather_texture_2016_image_tiles_5000.zip && rm Kather_texture_2016_image_tiles_5000.zip
mv Kather_texture_2016_image_tiles_5000 data

# Download Kather19 training data
wget -O NCT-CRC-HE-100K.zip https://zenodo.org/record/1214456/files/NCT-CRC-HE-100K.zip?download=1
unzip NCT-CRC-HE-100K.zip && rm NCT-CRC-HE-100K.zip
mv NCT-CRC-HE-100K data

# Download CRCTP training/test data
wget -O fold2.zip https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/cross_fac/tia/data/crc-tp/fold2.zip
7z x fold2.zip && rm fold2.zip
mv Fold2 data/CRCTP
```

###  Step 2: Create your Dataset (target)

To perform domain alignment we need to create a target set. To do so either use your own dataset or generate one using 
the following script. The `data_query` should indicate the query to the target whole slides images (*.mrxs, *.svs, ...). 
The script extracts from each whole slide `n_subset` tiles picked at random from the foreground and save them under 
`export` path.

```bash
python create_targets.py --data_query "/path/to/data/*.mrxs" --export data/GENERATED_TARGETS --n_subset 200
```

### Step 3: Train the model

To train the model with single-source domain:
```bash
# Define variables
DATASET_SRC="data/NCT-CRC-HE-100K"
DATASET_TAR="data/GENERATED_TARGETS"
# Train unsupervised architecture
python train_sra.py --root "${DATASET_SRC}:${DATASET_TAR}" --exp_name sra_k19
# Train linear classifier on top
# Note: You can use the model provided on the google drive (checkpoint_sra_k19_inhouse.pth)
python train_sra_cls.py --name="kather19" --root "${DATASET_SRC}" --loadpath=best_model_sra_k19.pth
```

To train the model with multi-source domain:
```bash
# Define variables
DATASET_SRC1="/data/CRCTP/Training"
DATASET_SRC2="data/NCT-CRC-HE-100K"
DATASET_TAR="data/GENERATED_TARGETS"
# Train unsupervised architecture
python train_sra.py --root="${DATASET_SRC1}:${DATASET_SRC2}:${DATASET_TAR}"  --exp_name sra_crctp_k19
# Train linear classifier on top
# Note: You can use the model provided on the google drive (checkpoint_sra_crctp_k19_inhouse.pth)
python train_sra_cls.py --name="crctp-cstr+kather19" --root "${DATASET_SRC1}:${DATASET_SRC2}" --loadpath=/path/to/pretrained/model.pth
```

### Step 4: WSIs Classification

The pre-trained models (with and without the linear classifier) are available in the pretrained moodle section. Here 
we show how to classify a [slide](https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/files/2d961af6-9f08-4db7-92b2-52b2380cd022
) taken from the TCGA cohort. The slides are available for download.

```bash
python infer_wsi_classification.py \
  --wsi_path TCGA-CK-6747-01Z-00-DX1.7824596c-84db-4bee-b149-cd8f617c285f.svs \
  --model_path best_model_srame_cls_k19.pth
```

You can find the predictions under the `Ã²utputs` folder

### Step 5: QuPath Visualization

You can visualize the predictions using [QuPath](https://qupath.github.io/). To do so follow the steps:
1. Open QuPath 
2. Open the WSIs image (*.mrsx, *.svs, ...)
3. Select `Automate->Show script editor`
4. Copy paste the script located under `SRA/script_qupath/annotation_loader.groovy`
5. Replace the variable `path` with the path to the json file containing the detection output. This file is generated 
   by the script `infer_wsi_classification.py` mentioned above.
6. Run the script (`Run->Run` or `CTRL+R`).
7. Enjoy

The expected output is display below in the results section.

## Results

### t-SNE

We present the t-SNE projection of the results of domain adaptation processes from Kather19 
to our in-house dataset.
![Kather19 to inhouse](figs/k19_inhouse_tsne.jpeg)

As well as the multi-source case
![CRCTP_Kather19 to inhouse](figs/crctp_k19_inhouse_tsne.jpeg)


To validate our approach on real case scenario, we perform domain adaptation using our 
proposed model from Kather19 to whole slide image 
sections from our in-house dataset. The results are presented here, alongside the original 
H&E image, their corresponding labels annotated by an expert pathologist, as well as 
comparative results of previous approaches smoothed using conditional random fields as 
in [L. Chan](https://github.com/lyndonchan/hsn_v1) (2018). The sections were selected such that, 
overall, they represent all tissue types equally.
